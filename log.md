# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday July 16 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
*Completed Lesson 1 on Pluralsight's "Getting started with React.js" https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=react-js-getting-started&author=samer-buna&name=react-js-getting-started-m1&clip=0&mode=live
*Joined Boostlog
*Joined IssueHunt

**Thoughts** 
*I want to get through this React tutorial as I feel like I've limited myself on frontend work by focusing on Angular.
*Once I have a grounding in React, will try to work on a pet project
